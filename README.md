    This project is an unobtrusive and plain JavaScript list pagination and filtering of any given list(44,54,64) amount of students and display 10 students per page and the rest on the last page. It'll display the list regardless if JavaScript is disable. There's 2 function, showpage() and appendPageLinks(). The showPage() is to index filter the amount into a page displaying a list of 10 each. The appendPageLinks() is to create pagination links thats append to the showPage()'s page. The page selected by the click event handler is active and highlighted in blue.
    The skills, techniques, and processes used are variables, functions, loops, conditionals, DOM, boolean logic, and event handler to name some. There's 2 global variable for both function to use. There's local variables that only the function within can access to. Elements are created, some given class, and appended.  Pagination links are created for the pages and event handler added to them. This is one example of many on list paination and filtering.
